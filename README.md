# Aleph #

Aleph is a high-level programming language designed to act as a Better C. C is
still a useful tool, but certain processes can be tedious or downright impossible
in C. This language looks to fill the gaps while not sacrificing compatibility,
speed, or portability; it compiles to C itself.

## Dependencies ##
Aleph depends on Flex for scanner generation, and a custom
parser that sits on top of the flex scanner. A transition
to Bison may be made in the future.
