# Alef #

Alef is a modern, clean replacement for the C programming language
inspired by [C2](http://c2lang.org/).

## Why not Rust/D/C++?

Rust imposes a lifetime system upon you, which although good for overall
safety, can be a burden at times. D comes with a garbage collector.
C++ is tightly coupled with C, and has terrible errors.

## Improvements over C (Work in progress)
- CTFE (Compile-time function execution)
- REPL for quick testing
- Strong + Static typing
- Module system

## Improvements over C2 (Work in progress)
- Named "Alef"

## Goals
- Higher Kinded Types
- Closures
- Type inference
- Traits
- LLVM/RTL Targets
- Integrated C compiler
