# Alef #

Alef is a replacement for the C programming language. It does not look to impose any new concepts like
lifetimes (Rust), object orientation (C++), or garbage collection (D/Java), but rather offer a clean,
modern version of C that is easily integratable into existing projects.

## Improvements over C (Work in progress)
- CTFE (Compile-time function execution)
- REPL for quick testing
- Strong + Static typing
- Module system

## Goals
- Higher Kinded Types
- Closures
- Type inference
- Traits
- LLVM/RTL Targets
